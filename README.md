## Project Goals:
1. To create a version of Clojure that gets to exist independent of a particular platform
2. To explore a Clojure that, being more independent, has
   1. Proper tail call elimination
   2. Conditions / Restarts
   3. Any other feature it might not normally be able to indulge
3. To, should the project progress, begin looking more serious into advanced compilation techniques, to create a serious Clojure implementation 

Check [clojureRS.org](./clojureRS.org) (the file, not website) for more notes about the design of the language, which should grow as the program grows.
